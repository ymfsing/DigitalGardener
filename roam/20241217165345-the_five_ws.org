The Five Ws is a checklist used in journalism to ensure that the "lead" or "lede" contains all the essential points of a story. As far back as 1913, reporters were taught that the lead/lede should answer these questions:

Who? - Asking about a person or animal
What? - Asking about an object or action
When? - Asking about a time
Where? - Asking about a place
Why? - Asking about a reason or cause
How? - Asking about the way something is done
